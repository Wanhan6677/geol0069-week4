Unsupervised learning helps us find patterns in data without using predefined labels. In this notebook, we focus on a practical workflow for classifying sea ice and leads in Earth observation data.

The notebook includes two main tasks:
1. Discrimination of Sea ice and lead based on image classification based on Sentinel-2 optical data. 
2. Discrimination of Sea ice and lead based on altimetry data classification based on Sentinel-3 altimetry data.
